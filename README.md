# Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Ideation

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences in web development. 

The goal of this project is also to learn new technologies focusing on
    
* React
* TypeScript
* GSAP for animations
* CSS

Above all else trying to learn frontend design patterns should be fun. Let's see.

## TODO

- [x] Set up the project with React and TypeScript.
- [x] Design the layout and structure of the portfolio website.
- [ ] Setup GSAP animation
