        <p>I am a Software Engineer currently developing .NET software applications while scaling database infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines to support modern industrial systems, with over 10 locations across the globe and more than 100 stations. 
I also contribute to teaching engineering courses for bachelor’s students, an experience that helps me grow continuously while sharing knowledge with others.
My interests lie in interactive, human-centred technologies. I want to create tools that make a real impact on how people experience and use software, and hope one day to achieve this.
